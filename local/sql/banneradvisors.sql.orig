-- The sql statement it to be used to extract a list of IDS from Banner
-- Example: sqlplus someid/somepwd @banneradvisors.sql

-- We don't want he column headers in our output file
set pagesize 0
-- We don't want the "nn records selected" message at the end
set feedback off
-- We don't want the IDs to go to stdout - only to the file
set termout off
set timing off
-- It is good to see what sql is being executed - but not to our output file
set echo off
-- We want the student IDs to go to this file always
-- The bannerextract script assumes this name will be used

-- We are selecting the advisors from the SGRADVR table for active students.
