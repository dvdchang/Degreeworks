To extract UCX table(s) you need to add one UCX table per line in this file (e.g. for the Major Table you would enter STU023).
Then uncomment the "bannerextract ucx nightly.ucx" line in the cron job script " /u01/home/dwadmin/cron/scripts/DW_nightly_maint.sh".
NOTE: Delete these comments before using.
Backup UCX tables before using the first time, using the dapucxunload command.
